# Energy-function-Q-calculation-via-investigetion-of-velocity-distriibution-function
Theory of stability for planar plasma diodes with charged particles beams in knudsen regime was described for non-reflection flows with using Q,G-method. Without going into details, functions Q and G, which describe energetic behavior of beams, are crucial for analitical approach. This program was made when creating theory for regime with particle reflections to make sure that function Q behave in a correct way.
Function distribution data provided by another numerical code, that calculate electric field for non-stationary process, is taken as initial file. User choses point in interelectrode gap, where he want to look at function Q, and velocity with wich partical arrivise there. Being that precision for velocities calculations is 16 signes after the decimal point, we have to chose particles with some velocity spread (can be changed in program). Then we set needed particles in corresponding spatial point (we need 3) and calculate function Q.
